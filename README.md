# What should I do next

> ðŸŽ±Mini web app to make fast and random decisions about what to do next during vacation time.

Decisions are hard, but I find them even harder during vacation when I often find myself stuck between what task to do next.

So I made this app to help me, to unstuck myself and do something.

Write **three tasks**, and the app will randomly choose one of them.

Why only three? Because I think that having a limited amount of options, help ourselves to prioritize and two possibilities are easy enough to choose between them.

## Donate

If you find this app useful, or you want to help a fellow one-eyed man, [consider donating a small amount of money](https://paypal.me/guanaiman).

Then a  cold beer will accompany me while coding stuff ;)
